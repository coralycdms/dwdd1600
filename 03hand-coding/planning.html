        <h1>Planning</h1>
        <h2>Let's get a score of 5!</h2>
        <p>Some of the steps to make that happen are:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Be Consistent With your Inquiry</dt>
            <dd>Sticking to your theme is <strong>crucial</strong>. That is the most important aspect of your portfolio. Your portfolio is answering your question/theme.</dd>

            <dt>Your Skills</dt>
            <dd>The artworks themselves need to demonstrate skill and effort. Sure, skill is a great thing to have, but by itself, it will not be able to drag you to 1st place. In this case, to getting a 5 on your AP art portfolio. Does your art have variety or are you a one trick pony? Your art needs to show continuous improvement until the end.</dd>

            <dt>Revision and Processes</dt>
            <dd>As stated above, showcasing improvement is a key to getting a high score. Sprinkling in some process pieces here and there will be in your favor. You can even choose to 'redo' a previous piece in your portfolio at a later date. However, do not rely on this too much. When in doubt, you've already done too many revisions! Start anew.</dd>

            <dt>Time Management</dt>
            <dd>As my beloved AP teacher once said, "Procrastination is a silent, but preventable, killer." That has proven to be true every day since I have heard it. You cannot grind out a well-produced painting or sculpture in 1 hour. Well, not consistently at least. Set apart time for your portfolio and you can avoid the embarrassment of submitting an unfinished art work.</dd>

            <dt>Applying Feedback</dt>
            <dd>Yes it hurts to have a valued piece of art of yours be criticized but remember this. Feedback for an artist is what water is to soil. It is meant to propel you forward and further into your art journey.</dd>

            <dt>You're like a Bird</dt>
            <dd>Yes, I am indeed quoting Nelly Furtado. Don't bind yourself to a cage. Allow room for experimentation even when it feels scary. Taking risks shows you are open to growth and lessons.</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>In sum, to put yourself out there, you have to be willing to bare yourself to the world. And unlike in the real world, this will make achieving a high score more likely.</p>
