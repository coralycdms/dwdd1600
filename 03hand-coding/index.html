        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>
            The fastest and most efficient way to interpret an artist and their reasoning for making art 
            is through their portfolios. A portfolio is more than just an accumulation of your best art. 
            It is the continuous story of <em>you</em>, the artist. <strong>What is your identity?</strong> 
            How does your art showcase that? 
        </p>
        <p>
            All of these are important considerations when starting a portfolio. The more in-depth you allow yourself to explore, the higher your score will get.
