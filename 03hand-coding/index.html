            <h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p>
                The fastest and most efficient way to interpret an artist and their ‘why’ (or reasoning) for making art is through their portfolios. A portfolio is more than just an accumulation of your best art. It is the continuous story of <em>you</em>, the artist. <strong>What is your identity?</strong> How does your art showcase that?
            </p>
            <p>
                All of these are important considerations when starting a portfolio. The more in-depth you allow yourself to explore, the higher your score will be.
