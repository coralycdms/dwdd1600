        <p>If you're hoping to get in touch with me for a portfolio review, the process is pretty straightforward. I usually accepts inquiries through my professional email or the contact form on my site-just a quick message introducing yourself and a description of your work  is enough to get the ball rolling. You don't need to stress about sounding overly formal. Just be clear with your selections and description, and let me know what score you are wanting for a pre-grading of your portfolio. I will guide you on the next steps.</p>

        <p>Before you send your work, there are a few simple prerequisites I need to know to keep everything organized and prevent damages. First, I want a short summary of the pieces you're including—titles, mediums, and any context that helps me understand your intent. I also asks that you confirm the portfolio is entirely your own original work (no collabs or class assignments without clear labels). <em>And most importantly: proper packaging is essential.</em> Make sure your portfolio is secure, protected from bending or moisture, and clearly labeled so it arrives in good shape. Once those basics are covered, you're all set to submit your request and ship your work her way.</p>
