        <h1>Portfolio 101</h1>
        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>The fastest and most efficient way to interpret an artist and their ‘why’ (or reasoning) for making art, is through their portfolios. A portfolio is more than just an accumulation of your best art. It is the continuous story of <em>you</em>, the artist. <strong>What is your identity?</strong> How does your art showcase that? 
            
            All of these are important considerations when starting a porfolio. The more in depth you allow yoourself to explore, the higher your score will get.
</p>

        <h2>How to Proceed</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pick between a 2D porfolio or a 3D one.</li>
            <li>What is your guiding inquiry?</li>
            <li>Map out possible pieces for future projetcs to ensure fluidity between the artworks by connecting the theme of your art works soundly.</li>
            <li>Explore and mess up!</li>
            
        </ol>
