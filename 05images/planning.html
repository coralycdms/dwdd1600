        <h1>Planning</h1>
        <h2>Let's get a score of 5!</h2>
        <p>Some of the steps to make that happen are:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Be Consistent With your Inquiry</dt>
            <dd>Sticking to your theme is <strong>crucical</strong>. That is the most important aspect of your portfolio. Your portfolio is answering your question/theme.</dd>

            <dt>Your Skills</dt>
            <dd>The artworks themselves need to demonstrate skill and effort. Sure, skill is a great thing to have, but by itself, it will not drag you to 1st place, well in this case, to getting a 5 on your AP art portfolio.</dd>

            <dt>Revision and Processes</dt>
            <dd>As stated above, showcasing improvement is key to getting a high score. Sprinkling in some process pieces here and there will be in your favor.</dd>

            <dt>Time Management</dt>
            <dd>You cannot grind out a well-produced painting or sculpture in 1 hour. Set apart time for your portfolio and avoid the embarrassment of submitting an unfinished artwork.</dd>

            <dt>Applying Feedback</dt>
            <dd>Feedback for an artist is what water is to soil. It propels you forward into your art journey.</dd>

            <dt>You're Like a Bird</dt>
            <dd>Don’t bind yourself to a cage. Allow room for experimentation even when it feels scary.</dd>
        </dl>

    

        <p>In sum, to put yourself out there, you have to be willing to bare yourself to the world. And unlike in the real world, this will make achieving a high score more likely.</p>
