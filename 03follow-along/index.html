        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>
            The fastest and most efficient way to interpret an artist and their ‘why’ (or reasoning) for making art, is through their portfolios. 
            A portfolio is more than just an accumulation of your best art. It is the continuous story of <em>you</em>, the artist. 
            <strong>What is your identity?</strong> How does your art showcase that? 
            All of these are important considerations when starting a portfolio. The more in depth you allow yourself to explore, the higher your score will get.

            <li>Map out possible pieces for future projects to ensure fluidity between the artworks by connecting the theme of your artworks soundly.</li>
